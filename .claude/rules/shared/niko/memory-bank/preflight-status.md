# Preflight Status

The preflight status file is a simple text file used to track the status of the preflight analysis phase of a task.

The preflight status file is stored in the `memory-bank/.preflight_status` file.

If pre-flight checks pass, the file contains the text `PASS`.

If pre-flight checks fail, the file should contain the text `FAIL`.
