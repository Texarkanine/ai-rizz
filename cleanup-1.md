# Test Suite Review and Refactor Plan

Review all test suites in the `tests/` directory (including both `unit/` and `integration/` subdirectories) for the `ai-rizz` project. The goals are:

## 1. Rearrangement and Grouping

- Organize test cases into logical groupings that reflect the main features and behaviors of `ai-rizz` as described in the README.md (e.g., initialization, rule/ruleset management, sync, deinit, etc.).
- If a test file covers too many unrelated features, split it into multiple, more focused test suites.

## 2. De-duplication

- Identify and remove any duplicate or redundant test cases across all test files.
- Ensure that each unique behavior is tested only once, in the most appropriate suite.

## 3. Suite Structure Improvement

- Ensure each test suite has a clear, descriptive name and purpose.
- Add or update suite-level comments to explain what is being tested and why.

## 4. Missing Coverage

- Compare the test coverage against all features and behaviors described in the README.md.
- Identify any features that are not currently tested and propose new test cases or suites to cover them.

## 5. Documentation

- Update and improve all test documentation and comments for clarity, accuracy, and completeness.

## 6. Planning

- Before making any code changes, produce a detailed plan that lists:
  - Which test files will be split, merged, or renamed.
  - Which test cases will be moved or removed.
  - Any new test suites you propose to create.
  - Any missing coverage and how you plan to address it.

## 7. Standards

- Ensure all changes are consistent with the testing practices and conventions described in the README.md (e.g., use of `make test`, quiet/verbose modes, etc.).

**Do not make any code changes until the plan is reviewed.**
