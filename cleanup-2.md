# Main Script Review and Refactor Plan

Review the main `ai-rizz` script for the following issues:

## 1. Bad Practices

- Identify and document any shell scripting anti-patterns or practices that violate the project's standards (as described in the README.md and any referenced rules).

## 2. Duplication

- Find and document any duplicated code, logic, or functions.
- Propose how to consolidate or refactor these duplications.

## 3. Useless Functions

- Identify any functions that are unused, redundant, or serve no meaningful purpose.
- Propose their removal or consolidation.

## 4. Inaccurate Documentation

- Review all inline documentation, comments, and function docstrings for accuracy and completeness.
- Ensure that documentation matches the actual behavior and flags supported, as described in the README.md.

## 5. Planning

- Before making any code changes, produce a detailed plan that lists:
  - Each issue found (bad practice, duplication, useless function, inaccurate doc, maintainability/extensibility).
  - The proposed fix for each issue.
  - Any refactoring or documentation updates you intend to make.

## 6. Standards

- Ensure all changes are consistent with the project's shell scripting and documentation standards.

**Do not make any code changes until the plan is reviewed.**
