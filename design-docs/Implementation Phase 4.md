## Phase 4 Implementation Progress

### ✅ Step 1: Enhanced Conflict Resolution Logic (COMPLETED)
**Objective**: Implement proper conflict resolution with correct ruleset handling

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Core conflict resolution working correctly with proper upgrade/downgrade constraints

#### ✅ 1.1 Fixed Ruleset Conflict Resolution
**Problem**: When promoting individual rules from local rulesets to commit mode, the entire local ruleset was being removed
**Solution**: Modified `remove_local_entries_deploying_file()` to detect "upgrade" scenarios
**Implementation**:
```bash
# Check if the commit manifest has the individual rule (not the ruleset)
rule_path="rules/${filename}"
if [ -f "${COMMIT_MANIFEST_FILE}" ] && read_manifest_entries "${COMMIT_MANIFEST_FILE}" | grep -q "^${rule_path}$"; then
    # This is an upgrade scenario - individual rule promoted to commit
    # Keep the local ruleset for other rules it contains
    continue
else
    # This is a true conflict - remove the entire local ruleset
    remove_manifest_entry_from_file "${LOCAL_MANIFEST_FILE}" "${entry}"
fi
```

**Result**: Local rulesets now correctly remain when individual rules are promoted to commit mode

#### ✅ 1.2 Implemented Downgrade Prevention
**Objective**: Prevent individual rules from being moved from committed rulesets to local mode
**Implementation**: Added validation in `cmd_add_rule()`:
```bash
# Check for downgrade conflicts: prevent adding individual rules to local mode 
# when they're part of a committed ruleset
if [ "$mode" = "local" ] && [ "$HAS_COMMIT_MODE" = "true" ]; then
    # Check if this rule is part of any committed ruleset
    rule_filename=$(basename "$rule_path")
    commit_entries=$(read_manifest_entries "$COMMIT_MANIFEST_FILE" 2>/dev/null || true)
    
    if [ -n "$commit_entries" ]; then
        # Check each committed entry to see if it's a ruleset containing this rule
        echo "$commit_entries" | while IFS= read -r entry; do
            if [ -n "$entry" ]; then
                entry_path="$REPO_DIR/$entry"
                if [ -d "$entry_path" ]; then
                    # This is a ruleset - check if it contains our rule
                    if find "$entry_path" -name "$rule_filename" -type f -o -name "$rule_filename" -type l | grep -q .; then
                        warn "Cannot add individual rule '$rule' to local mode: it's part of committed ruleset '$entry'. Use 'ai-rizz add-ruleset $(basename "$entry") --local' to move the entire ruleset."
                        continue 2  # Skip to next rule in outer loop
                    fi
                fi
            fi
        done
    fi
fi
```

**Result**: Clear warning messages when attempting invalid downgrades

#### ✅ 1.3 Integrated Conflict Resolution into Sync
**Location**: Modified `sync_all_modes()` function
**Implementation**: Successfully integrated conflict resolution:
- Calls `resolve_conflicts()` before syncing directories
- Ensures commit mode wins for any duplicate files
- Works correctly with both single-mode and dual-mode setups

### ✅ Step 2: Correct Upgrade/Downgrade Behavior (COMPLETED)
**Objective**: Implement proper constraints for ruleset and individual rule movements

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - All constraints properly implemented

#### ✅ 2.1 Ruleset Movement Rules
**Implementation**: Rulesets can move freely in both directions:
- ✅ **Ruleset: local → commit** (upgrade) - Works correctly
- ✅ **Ruleset: commit → local** (downgrade) - Works correctly

#### ✅ 2.2 Individual Rule Movement Rules  
**Implementation**: Individual rules have proper constraints:
- ✅ **Individual rule: local → commit** (upgrade) - Works correctly
- ❌ **Individual rule: commit → local** (downgrade) - **Correctly prevented with warning**

#### ✅ 2.3 Complex Scenarios
**Scenario**: Local ruleset with individual rule promotion
- ✅ **Setup**: `ruleset1` (containing `rule1.mdc`, `rule2.mdc`) in local mode
- ✅ **Action**: Promote `rule1.mdc` to commit mode individually  
- ✅ **Result**: 
  - `rule1.mdc` shows committed glyph (●)
  - `rule2.mdc` shows local glyph (◐) 
  - `ruleset1` remains in local mode for `rule2.mdc`

### ✅ Step 3: Enhanced Test Coverage (COMPLETED)
**Objective**: Add comprehensive tests for all conflict scenarios

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - All scenarios properly tested

#### ✅ 3.1 Updated Existing Tests
**Fixed**: `test_list_rulesets_correct_glyphs` to test correct upgrade scenario:
```bash
test_list_rulesets_correct_glyphs() {
    # Setup: Test the correct behavior - individual rules can't be downgraded from committed rulesets
    cmd_init "$SOURCE_REPO" -d "$TARGET_DIR" --local
    cmd_add_ruleset "ruleset1" --local  # Add ruleset to local mode first
    cmd_add_rule "rule1.mdc" --commit   # Promote individual rule to commit mode (upgrade)
    
    output=$(cmd_list)
    
    # Expected: rule1 should show commit glyph (promoted), ruleset1 should show local glyph (still has rule2)
    echo "$output" | grep -q "$COMMITTED_GLYPH.*rule1" || fail "Should show committed glyph for rule1 (promoted from local ruleset)"
    echo "$output" | grep -q "$LOCAL_GLYPH.*ruleset1" || fail "Should show local glyph for ruleset1 (still contains rule2)"
}
```

#### ✅ 3.2 Added New Tests
**Added**: `test_prevent_rule_downgrade_from_committed_ruleset`:
```bash
test_prevent_rule_downgrade_from_committed_ruleset() {
    # Setup: Committed ruleset with rule1 and rule2
    cmd_init "$SOURCE_REPO" -d "$TARGET_DIR" --commit
    cmd_add_ruleset "ruleset1" --commit
    
    # Test: Try to add individual rule from committed ruleset to local mode (should warn and be no-op)
    output=$(cmd_add_rule "rule1.mdc" --local 2>&1 || echo "ERROR_OCCURRED")
    
    # Expected: Should warn about downgrade prevention
    echo "$output" | grep -q "Cannot add individual rule.*part of committed ruleset" || fail "Should warn about downgrade prevention"
    
    # Verify rule1 is still only in commit mode (not added to local)
    list_output=$(cmd_list)
    echo "$list_output" | grep -q "$COMMITTED_GLYPH.*rule1" || fail "Rule1 should still show committed glyph"
    if echo "$list_output" | grep -q "$LOCAL_GLYPH.*rule1"; then
        fail "Rule1 should not have been added to local mode"
    fi
}
```

### ✅ Step 4: Code Quality and Architecture (COMPLETED)
**Objective**: Clean up code and improve maintainability

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Code simplified and improved

#### ✅ 4.1 Repository Directory Handling
- ✅ **Global `${REPO_DIR}` Usage**: All functions now use the global variable directly
- ✅ **Test Framework Compatibility**: `REPO_DIR` override works correctly in tests
- ✅ **Removed Indirection**: No more unnecessary local variable assignments

#### ✅ 4.2 Function Cleanup
- ✅ **Removed**: `restore_non_conflicting_rules_from_ruleset()` (no longer needed with correct logic)
- ✅ **Simplified**: Conflict resolution logic to handle upgrade scenarios properly
- ✅ **Improved**: Error messages and user feedback

## Implementation Architecture (COMPLETED)

### Core Conflict Resolution Functions
```bash
# Get all .mdc files that would be deployed by a manifest
get_files_from_manifest() {
    # Returns one filename per line (just the filename, not the full path)
    # Handles both individual rules and rulesets correctly
}

# Remove local entries that would deploy the same file as commit mode
# This handles the "upgrade" case (local → commit) by removing conflicting local entries
remove_local_entries_deploying_file() {
    # Enhanced to detect upgrade scenarios and preserve local rulesets
    # when individual rules are promoted to commit mode
}

# Main conflict resolution (commit wins)
resolve_conflicts() {
    # Comprehensive conflict resolution at the file level
    # Handles complex ruleset overlaps correctly
}
```

### Upgrade/Downgrade Validation
```bash
# In cmd_add_rule() - prevents invalid downgrades
if [ "$mode" = "local" ] && [ "$HAS_COMMIT_MODE" = "true" ]; then
    # Check if this rule is part of any committed ruleset
    # Warn and skip if attempting to downgrade individual rule
fi
```

## Verified Behavior (COMPLETED)

### ✅ Ruleset Movement (Both Directions)
- ✅ **Local Ruleset → Commit**: Works correctly, all rules migrate
- ✅ **Commit Ruleset → Local**: Works correctly, all rules migrate

### ✅ Individual Rule Movement (Upgrade Only)
- ✅ **Local Rule → Commit**: Works correctly, rule migrates
- ❌ **Commit Rule → Local**: **Correctly prevented** with clear warning

### ✅ Complex Scenarios
- ✅ **Individual Rule Promotion from Local Ruleset**: Local ruleset preserved for remaining rules
- ✅ **Conflict Resolution**: Commit mode wins, duplicates removed silently
- ✅ **Glyph Display**: Correct symbols for all scenarios (●, ◐, ○)

### ✅ Error Handling
- ✅ **Downgrade Prevention**: Clear warning messages
- ✅ **Repository Validation**: Proper error checking during initialization
- ✅ **Manifest Integrity**: Validation and error recovery

## Success Criteria (ACHIEVED)
