# Progress: M3 — slobac-audit-fixes-2

Sub-run for **L4 milestone M3**: reorganize wrong-level (real filesystem/git) tests from `tests/unit/` into a dedicated integration sub-tier; update runners and project docs. **No production script changes.**

**Complexity:** Level 3

## 2026-05-07 — COMPLEXITY-ANALYSIS COMPLETE

- M2 milestone closed via `/niko` Step 2a; classification target is M3 (finding 16). Determined **Level 3** (multi-component test layout + Makefile/runner/docs; bounded milestone per `milestones.md`).

## 2026-05-07 — PLAN COMPLETE

- `tasks.md` holds full L3 plan: inventory-first relocation of wrong-level `unit/` suites into `tests/integration/functions/`, doc updates (`techContext`, `systemPatterns`, `ai-rizz-development.mdc`, `README`), runner/common.sh audit. Open questions: none. Technology validation: N/A.

## 2026-05-07 — PREFLIGHT COMPLETE

- **PASS** — TDD ordering explicit per batch; scope and conventions verified; advisory only on `run_tests.sh` help text. Status in `memory-bank/active/.preflight-status`.

## 2026-05-07 — BUILD COMPLETE

- Relocated 25 `tests/unit/*.test.sh` files to `tests/integration/functions/` (finding 16 remediation); retained `tests/unit/test_skill_detection.test.sh` only.
- Path fixes: `tests/common.sh` via `$(dirname "$0")/../../common.sh`; bundled `shunit2` at repo root via `$(dirname "$0")/../../../shunit2`.
- Docs/rules/README and `run_tests.sh` usage lines updated for three-tier taxonomy; no changes to production `ai-rizz`.
- Verification: `make test` — 33 suites passed (1 unit, 32 integration including `integration/functions/`).

## 2026-05-07 — QA COMPLETE

- **PASS** — Reviewed implementation against `tasks.md` / `projectbrief.md`: KISS/DRY/YAGNI, completeness (finding 16 relocation + docs), regression risk (path fixes only), integrity (no stray debug). Preflight advisory (`run_tests.sh` mentioning `integration/functions/`) satisfied in build. Legacy `# TODO` comments in two moved suites noted as pre-existing, out of M3 scope.
- Verification: `make test` — 33 suites passed; status in `memory-bank/active/.qa-validation-status`.
